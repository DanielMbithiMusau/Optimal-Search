# Optimal Search
The essence of this project is to use search algorithms to find the shortest path between 10 towns in Kenya.
The graphical user interface let's you choose which algorithm to use and the towns to go through.

The search algorithms implemented include:
`Breadth-first search`
`A-star search`
`Depth-first search`

The GUI map was implemented using openstreetmap and geocode.
